YouTube Channel Information Extraction and Analysis

This project aims to develop a user-friendly Streamlit application that utilizes the Google API to extract information on a YouTube channel. The extracted data is stored in a MongoDB database, then migrated to a SQL data warehouse. The application enables users to search for channel details and join tables to view data in the Streamlit app.

Features

    Extracts information on a YouTube channel using the Google API
    Stores the extracted data in a MongoDB database
    Migrates the data from MongoDB to a SQL data warehouse
    Enables users to search for channel details
    Provides the ability to join tables and view data in the Streamlit app

Usage

    Open the Streamlit application in your browser
    Enter the YouTube channel ID(s)
    Click on the "submit" button to extract information from the YouTube channel
    Click the 'choose a table' button to get the result in the form of table
